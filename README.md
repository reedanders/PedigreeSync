# PedigreeSync: NFC Livestock Tag System

This project is an **open-source mobile and web application** for managing livestock records using **NFC-enabled ear tags**. Designed with small livestock producers, the system allows producers to scan tags with an iPhone, view or update health records offline, and sync them to a centralized cloud database when connectivity is available.

This application was developed as a farmer-led research initiative supporting **animal welfare, decentralized data ownership, and the right to repair**.

## ðŸšœ Purpose

Most livestock management tools are either expensive, proprietary, or require specialized RFID hardware. This project provides an alternative: a **low-cost, open-source platform** built around NFC tags readable by consumer smartphones. It is ideal for producers without dedicated IT infrastructure, and those who prioritize animal handling efficiency, welfare monitoring, and data transparency.

## Features

### Phase 1 â€“ Web Admin Dashboard (Testing)
- View and edit synced records in a React web interface
- Add flock metadata and batch operations
- Secure authentication and multi-device access

### Phase 2 â€“ Mobile Scan Integration (WIP)
- Scan NFC ear tags using iPhone (React Native + iOS Core NFC)
- Store and view records locally
- Sync records to Supabase when online
- Manage livestock profiles and events (health, weight, lambing)

### Phase 3 â€“ Field Validation & Community Tools (Planned)
- Usability testing across 3+ ranches
- Environmental durability logging
- Data export for NSIP/EBV pipelines
- Community support for forking/customization
