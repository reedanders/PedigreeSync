# PedigreeSync: Scan NFC-enabled livestock eartags with an iPhone

This project is an **open-source mobile and web application** for managing livestock records using **NFC-enabled ear tags**. Designed with small livestock producers, the system allows producers to scan tags with an iPhone, view or update health records offline, and sync them to a centralized cloud database when connectivity is available.

This application was developed as a farmer-led research initiative supporting **animal welfare and the right to repair**.

## ðŸšœ Purpose

Most livestock management tools are either expensive, proprietary, or require specialized RFID hardware. This project provides an alternative: a **low-cost, open-source platform** built around NFC tags readable by consumer smartphones. It is ideal for producers without expensive RFID scanners, and those who prioritize animal handling efficiency, welfare monitoring, and right to repair.
