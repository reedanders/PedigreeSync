# PedigreeSync: Unofficial PedigreeMaster Web Application

This project is an **unofficial implementation of PedigreeMaster**, a widely used Windows-based software in the National Sheep Improvement Program (NSIP). This application aims to modernize and simplify data recording and analysis for livestock breeders by offering a phased implementation of core functionalities.

## Vision

The goal of this project is to provide a web-based alternative to the Windows-based PedigreeMaster with enhanced usability and accessibility. The application will eventually incorporate all functionalities of PedigreeMaster, with additional modern features to streamline data management for livestock improvement programs.

## Key Features (Planned Development Phases)

1. **Flock Data Recording**:
   - Allow users to input flock data, including animal IDs, pedigree details, and trait measurements.
   - Support for data export in formats compatible with PedigreeMaster for further analysis.

2. **Data Analysis Import and Display**:
   - Import analyzed data (e.g., Estimated Breeding Values (EBVs)).
   - Provide intuitive data visualizations and detailed reports.

3. **RFID Integration** (Future Phase):
   - Enable data import from RFID devices for real-time livestock tracking.
   - Streamline integration of electronic records with pedigree data.

4. **Other Advanced Features** (Future Phase):
   - Incorporate functionalities like genetic trend analysis and comprehensive reporting tools.
   - Provide robust backup and data validation options.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- A compatible web browser
- Access to an NSIP-compliant flock dataset (optional for testing)

## Usage

1. **Input Flock Data**:
   - Navigate to the `Flock` section to record animal IDs, weights, and other relevant data.
   - Use the export feature to generate PedigreeMaster-compatible files.

2. **View and Import Analyzed Data**:
   - Access the `Analysis` section to upload EBVs and view them through interactive dashboards.

3. **Future Features**:
   - RFID integration and additional data management tools will be available in subsequent updates.
